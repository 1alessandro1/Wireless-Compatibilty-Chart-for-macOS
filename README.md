# Wireless-Compatibilty-Chart-for-macOS
This repository is an initial draft for an extensive collection of wireless devices compatible with macOS

## Note: 
Many cards have incorrect information regarding macOS support, Device-ID fixes, and bluetooth support. Please report that with an issue and I'll fix that, the template with the necessary data required is this one:
